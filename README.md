Unit testing ensures that all code meets quality standards before it's deployed.Over the course of the product development life cycle, unit testing saves time and money, and helps developers write better code, more efficiently.Using service we check some business logic and save and fetch data to/from the database and return to our controllers.We are testing the service layer. So we don't require a database layer actual operation. So we will make the database layer mock.Created a new package called service under src/test/java/com/tgt/rysetii/learningresourcesapi.and created a new class named LearningResourceServiceTests under the package service.Performed the unit tests for all the methods listed out in the LearningResourceService class.
